                    <h2>Accounting</h2>
                    Maintaining good accounting practices and up-to-date 
                    accounting records allows one to make informed decisions 
                    about oneâ€™s business; it also gives potential investors 
                    and banks confidence to finance the business for expansion 
                    when required. We help our clients interpret and apply the accounting 
                    standards from record keeping to presentation and 
                    disclosure on the annual financial statements.
                </div>
                <div class="service-item js-r">
                    <img class="gw-icon" src="pics/droppedImage1.png" alt="" width="70px" >
                    <h2>Audit</h2>
                    An audit of the annual financial statements is beneficial 
                    to an entity not only from the attest function provided by 
                    the auditors but also the value adding product of the 
                    auditor's risk based approach carried out during the audit. 
                    Note that the Companies Act of 2008 allows privately owned 
                    companies the option of not having the annual financial 
                    statements audited; this takes the burden off small owner 
                    managed companies in respect of the audit fees.

                    <h2>Bookkeeping</h2>
                    We provide bookkeeping services to our clients if requested; 
                    bookkeeping is the recording of financial transactions to the 
                    trial balance level.

                    <h2>Company Secretarial Services</h2>
                    The Companies Act sets out administrative rules that requires 
                    every company to document meetings, decisions and directors 
                    interest in the dealing of the company. Where a business employs 
                    staff, they  need to register with the Unemployment Insurance Fund 
                    (UIF) and the Compensation Fund. We advise our clients on the 
                    legislative requirements for a company and help maintain and 
                    submit documentation to relevant authorities.

                    <h2>Tax</h2>
                    With the tax laws constantly changing, it is hard for business 
                    owners to keep up-to-date with the latest changes. We work with 
                    our clients and keep them updated on the developments in the rules 
                    relevant to them. We also assist businesses in the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Monthly tax returns (PAYE, UIF, SDL)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Bi-monthly VAT returns
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Bi-annual employer's reconciliation for employees tax
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Provisional (IRP6) and yearend (IT14) tax returns
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Tax advisory
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                   
                </div>

                    <h2>Audit File Preparation</h2>
                    An audit is an expensive exercise for any business; audit fees are 
                    based on the time a team of professionals take to gather enough 
                    information to be able to satisfy themselves that the annual financial 
                    statements of an entity is not materially misstated. We help an entity 
                    gather and arrange documents required for an audit so the audit can be 
                    performed efficiently thus creating a saving in the audit fees.
